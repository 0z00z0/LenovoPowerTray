# Lenovo Power Tray

A lightweight Windows **system-tray app** for Lenovo ThinkPad laptops (built and tested on an
**X1 Yoga Gen 7**) that toggles two power features without opening the slow Lenovo Vantage app:

- **Smart Charge** — battery charge threshold, via the Lenovo Power Manager local-RPC interface
  (the same one Lenovo Vantage uses), through a small native bridge (`LenPower.dll`)
- **Smart Standby** — Modern Standby scheduling, via the `LenovoSmartStandby` Windows service

Left-click the tray icon for a battery dashboard (arc gauge with live % and charge-rate, threshold
tick markers, adjustable start/stop sliders); right-click for quick toggles plus a launch-at-startup
option. The tray icon itself shows a live battery-level arc, colour-coded green/orange/red.

## Install

**winget** (recommended):

```powershell
winget install 0z00z0.LenovoPowerTray
winget upgrade 0z00z0.LenovoPowerTray   # update later
```

Or grab `LenovoPowerTray-Setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/0z00z0/LenovoPowerTray/releases)
and run it. The installer is **per-user — no admin needed to install** — and offers two options:

- **Run at startup** — auto-starts the app at sign-in. Ticking it asks for elevation once, to
  register a prompt-free elevated logon task.
- **Auto update in background** — a logon task that silently runs `winget upgrade` after each
  sign-in, so the app keeps itself current. Needs no elevation, and only works once the package is
  available from a winget source (see [installer/README.md](installer/README.md)).

The app itself shows a UAC prompt when it launches, since changing the charge threshold / standby
service requires administrator rights.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 (1809+) / Windows 11 on a Lenovo ThinkPad
- **Administrator rights** — both features require elevation (the app manifest declares
  `requireAdministrator`)

### Smart Charge prerequisite — Lenovo Power Management Driver

Smart Charge talks directly to the **Lenovo Power Management Driver** (Windows service `PWMGR`,
"Lenovo Power and Battery") — the same service Lenovo Vantage uses under the hood.

**You do not need Lenovo Vantage.** You do need the driver.

It ships as part of the ThinkPad hardware driver package. If your laptop originally shipped with
Windows (or has had a full driver installation) it is almost certainly already present.

To check — run in an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Service -Name PWMGR -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

If the service appears (`Running` or `Stopped`), Smart Charge will work. If nothing is returned,
install the driver:

1. Go to your model's driver page on [Lenovo Support](https://support.lenovo.com/) (search your
   model name / serial number, or use
   [PC Support Auto-Detect](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht003029)).
2. Select **Drivers & Software → category Power Management**.
3. Download and run **"Power Management Driver for Windows 10 and 11 (64-bit)"**.

If the driver is absent, Smart Charge shows as **Unavailable** in the tray and dashboard — the
rest of the app (Smart Standby, auto-start, battery gauge) works fine without it.

### Build prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK
- A C++ toolset (Visual Studio / Build Tools with **"Desktop development with C++"**) to build the
  native Smart Charge bridge (`native/`) — only needed once

## Build from source

```powershell
# 1. Build the native Smart Charge bridge (LenPower.dll). One-time, needs the C++ toolset.
#    build.cmd locates MSVC + MIDL automatically (incl. VS 2026 Insiders).
cd native
.\build.cmd
cd ..

# 2. Build the app (Release output is Authenticode-signed if a cert is set up — see USAGE.md).
#    The csproj copies native\LenPower.dll next to the executable.
dotnet build -c Release

# 3. Run elevated
dotnet run
# or right-click the compiled LenovoTray.exe → "Run as administrator"
```

> Smart Standby, the dashboard, and auto-start work without the native bridge. If `LenPower.dll`
> is missing, Smart Charge simply shows as **Unavailable** rather than breaking the app.

A UAC prompt appears on first launch. Enable **Launch at startup** from the right-click menu to
auto-start prompt-free on subsequent boots (via a Task Scheduler logon task).

See **[USAGE.md](USAGE.md)** for full usage, code-signing, troubleshooting, and architecture notes.

## Building the installer

The per-user installer is built with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and distributed
via winget. See **[installer/README.md](installer/README.md)** for the full release workflow:

```powershell
winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup     # one-time
cd installer
.\build-installer.ps1              # auto-bumps patch (or pass -Version 1.0.0 explicitly)
```

## External libraries

The app targets the Microsoft stack (.NET, Windows App SDK / WinUI 3, `System.*` runtime
packages). The only **non-Microsoft** dependencies are:

| Library | Author | Purpose | License |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| [H.NotifyIcon.WinUI](https://github.com/HavenDV/H.NotifyIcon) | HavenDV | System-tray icon + native context menu for WinUI 3 | MIT |
| [TaskScheduler](https://github.com/dahall/TaskScheduler) | David Hall | Managed wrapper over the Windows Task Scheduler API (auto-start) | MIT |

## Credits & acknowledgements

Smart Charge is the hard part: ThinkPad firmware does **not** expose the battery charge threshold
through WMI, so it has to be driven over the Lenovo Power Manager's local-RPC interface — the same
one Lenovo Vantage uses.

- **[LenPwrCtl](https://github.com/alandau/LenPwrCtl)** by **alandau** (MIT) — the Power Manager RPC
  interface in [`native/pwrmgr.idl`](native/pwrmgr.idl) (endpoint, context handles, and the
  `LpcGetChargeThreshold` / `LpcSetChargeThreshold` procedure layout) was **reverse-engineered by
  this project** and is reused here under its MIT license. This app would not be possible without it.
  Huge thanks. 🙏

The `native/` bridge (`lenpower.c`) is a thin wrapper that exposes two flat exports over that
interface for the managed app to P/Invoke; the interface definition itself is alandau's work.
